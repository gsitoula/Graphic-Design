# Note Index n°1
-------------------

I´ve tried to recreate the note in the page of the Rolling Stone magazine that you will find in the 'source' folder.
From there, i made most of the information about the note a '.JSON' file, and use AngularJS and Bootstrap to display accurately all the 'data' in the 'rows' on the index of the webpage.
From now on, i will be trying to make some directives and modules to bring some responsiveness to the web page.
